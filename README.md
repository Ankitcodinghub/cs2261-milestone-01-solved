First Playable

Purpose: To build the first playable version of your project leveraging Mode 0, good code architecture, and other concepts learned over the course of the semester.

Instructions:

For this milestone, you will be implementing the key components that make your game what it is. I would highly recommend saving each milestone separately so that you have something to revert to if there are strange problems occurring down the road. When you start on a new milestone, you can just copy the folder and rename it to the current milestone, then continue working.

This milestone has two primary components.

Part 1:

Implement the state machine that your game will use. You must have at least the following states with the following characteristics:

‚ûî SPLASH (or MENU, or START)

‚óÜ From here, the player can go to GAME and INSTRUCTIONS

‚ûî INSTRUCTIONS

‚óÜ From here, the player can go to SPLASH and/or GAME

‚ûî GAME (must be in a tiled mode, such as Mode 0)

‚óÜ From here, the player can go to PAUSE and WIN/LOSE ‚ûî PAUSE

‚óÜ From here, the player can go to GAME and SPLASH (restarting the game) ‚ûî WIN and/or LOSE (depending on what you proposed your game needs)

‚óÜ From here, the player can go back to SPLASH

Part 2:

Begin implementing the core gameplay that you proposed. You must use sprites to accomplish this. Your implementation for M01 does not have to be the final version of the gameplay components, as you will tweak and update it with each milestone until you are happy with the way that it works. The core functionality, however, must be completed.

For example, if your game were something like Super Mario Bros., you would need to have a player that can run around and jump on platforms. If your game were like Galaga, you would need to have a player that can move and shoot, and bullets that destroy enemies. Check your feedback for M00, and make sure you are implementing the things we recommend you have done by M01. Your submission will be graded according to the feedback given.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT: at the top of your main.c file, include a comment block that explains the following: what is finished about the game so far, what still needs to be added, any bugs you have found, and, for our sake, how to play the game in its current state (and see anything you want us to see).

Do not get bogged down with art at this point! If you finish the other M01 requirements and suggestions, go for it, but I would recommend making all the sprites just squares at this point. Your state screens should be labeled in some way, but the text tool in Usenti should do well enough for this Milestone. Your time will be better spent getting more of the core functionality implemented.

Submission Instructions:

Ensure that cleaning and building/running your project still gives the expected results. Please reference previous assignments for instructions on how to perform a ‚Äúclean‚Äù command if you need clarification.

Compress your entire project folder, including all source files, the Makefile, and everything produced during compilation (including the .gba file). Submit this zip on Canvas. Name your submission M01_LastnameFirstname, for example:

‚ÄúM01_BittelTurvis.zip‚Äù
